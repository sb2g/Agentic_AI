The third sports ultra-light SG001 Aviators with teardrop lenses in a barely-there metal frame, lenses mirroring the city skyline. Soft lens flares, glossy reflections, lush palm fronds and a modern skyline in the background create a carefree summer 2025 vibe.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n",

The first wears oversized chunky wayfarer sunglasses in electric cobalt blue, reflecting neon festival lights; the second sports glossy Mystique cat-eye frames with subtle temple jewels and rose-tinted lenses, hair tousled by a warm breeze. In the background, a third figure casually adjusts a classic slim-metal aviator with amber lenses. Lens flare dances across the frame, pastel skies fade into sunset, and scattered confetti drifts through a shallow depth of field, creating a vibrant, cinematic vibe.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n",

    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  \n",
    "- Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  \n",
    "- Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  \n",
    "- Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  \n",
    "- Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  \n",
    "- Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.  \n",
