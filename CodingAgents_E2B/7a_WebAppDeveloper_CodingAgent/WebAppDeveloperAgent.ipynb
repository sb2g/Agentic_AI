    "E2B provides secure cloud sandboxes with these capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolated execution** - Code runs in secure microVM\n",
    "2. **File system** - Create, read, write, delete files\n",
    "3. **Multiple languages** - Python, JavaScript, Bash\n",
    "4. **Web hosting** - Serve applications on custom ports\n",
    "5. **Persistent** - Reconnect to existing sandboxes by ID\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use sandboxes?**\n",
    "- Execute untrusted LLM-generated code safely\n",
    "- Avoid polluting your local environment\n",
    "- Access pre-installed packages and tools\n",
    "- Serve web applications with public URLs\n",

    "**Create Sandbox:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sbx = Sandbox.create(timeout=60 * 60)  # 1 hour\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Execute Code:**\n",

    "execution = sbx.run_code(\"print('Hello')\")\n",
    "result = execution.to_json()\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Handle Results:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Access stdout/stderr\n",
    "print(execution.results)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access images (PNG data)\n",
    "for result in execution.results:\n",

    "        # Store base64 PNG data\n",
    "        png_data = result.png\n",

    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "1. Import display and IFrame from IPython.display, and import time\n",
    "2. Modify execute_code to use sbx.run_code() instead of local exec()\n",
    "3. Return execution.to_json() and metadata dict as tuple\n",
    "4. Define execute_code_schema (same as before, LLM doesn't know about sbx parameter)\n",
    "5. Modify execute_tool to pass sbx to all tool functions\n",
    "6. Update coding_agent signature to include sbx: Sandbox parameter\n",
    "7. Create sandbox with Sandbox.create(timeout=3600)\n",
    "8. Define system prompt: \"You are a web development agent. You MUST use execute_code to write all files to /home/user/ directory using Python code with open(). Never return code as text - always execute Python to write files.\"\n",
    "9. Run agent with query \"Create a simple calculator app with HTML/CSS/JS in index.html\"\n",
    "10. After agent completes, start HTTP server in /home/user directory: sbx.commands.run(\"cd /home/user && python -m http.server 3000 --bind 0.0.0.0\", background=True)\n",
    "11. Wait 3 seconds for server to start: time.sleep(3)\n",
    "12. Get host URL with sbx.get_host(3000)\n",
    "13. Use display(IFrame(f\"https://{host}\", width=800, height=600)) to render the calculator in notebook output\n",
