    "3. Replace exec() with sbx.run_code(code) and capture execution object\n",

    "5. For results with PNG data, store in metadata dict and set result.png = None\n",
    "6. Return execution.to_json() and metadata dict as tuple\n",
    "7. Define execute_code_schema (same as before, LLM doesn't know about sbx parameter)\n",
    "8. Update execute_tool to pass sbx=sbx kwarg to tools\n",
    "9. Update coding_agent to accept sbx parameter and pass it to execute_tool\n",
    "10. Create test: sbx = Sandbox.create(timeout=3600), run agent with query \"Generate 50 random numbers and plot histogram\"\n",
    "11. After agent completes, decode and display images: for each png_data in metadata[\"images\"], use display(Image(data=base64.b64decode(png_data))) to convert the base64 string from E2B to binary data for IPython\n",
