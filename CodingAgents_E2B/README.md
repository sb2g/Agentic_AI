## Overview:
- This repo covers some techniques & concepts on building Coding Agents and how to use E2B to execute them in a sandbox environment, along with my example notebooks from https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/building-coding-agents-with-tool-execution/.
- It covers how to:
    - Build basic Coding Agents (2_CodingAgent)
    - Use E2B sandbox environment to execute the Coding Agents (4_CodingAgent_E2B)
    - Build various Coding Agents & execute them in E2B:
        - Data analyst Agent (5_CodingAgent_DataAnalyst)
        - Full stack web developer Agent (6_CodingAgent_FullStackDeveloper)
        - Using Jupyter AI to build these Web app developer and Data analyst Agents (7a_WebDeveloper_CodingAgent, 7b_DataAnalyzer_CodingAgent)
